##### Step 3.a
'''
Implement an XGBoost training function.  Called from utilities/xgb_utils.py.

This should be very similar to the how training is done in the LTR toy program.

:param str xgb_train_data: The file path to the training data you should train with
:param int num_rounds: The number of rounds the training process should undertake before terminating.
:param dictionary xgb_params The XGBoost configuration parameters, such as the objective function, e.g. {'objective': 'reg:logistic'} 
'''
def train(xgb_train_data, num_rounds=5, xgb_params=None ):
    dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(f'{xgb_train_data}?format=libsvm')
    return xgb.train(xgb_params, dtrain, num_rounds)

##### Step 3.b:
'''
We need to log/extract features for our training data set.  This is a critical step in the 
LTR process where we request features (from the featureset we definied) of all of the documents that match a given query from OpenSearch.
For instance, we might get back the TF-IDF score for a document given our query.

Called from ltr_utils.py

Unlike in the toy LTR example where we issued a single query to OpenSearch per query-document pair, you should be able to retrieve 
all features for all documents in a single query.  See the course content for more details. 

:param str query: The user query to run
:param array doc_ids: An array/list of doc ids that users have clicked on for this query. 
:param str click_prior_query: A query string representing what documents were clicked on in the past.  Not used until the 'Using Prior Query History' section of the project.
:param str featureset_name: The name of the featureset we should use to extract features from OpenSearch with
:param str ltr_store_name: The name of the LTR store we are using to extract features from
:param int size: The number of results to return in the search result set
:param string terms_field: The name of the field to filter our doc_ids on

##### Step 4.e:
'''
Modify the query_obj to add a `rescore` entry that uses the baseline query, the LTR information and the rescore window to 
create a new query that actually does the rescoring using our LTR model.
Called from ltr_utils.py
